# Fruit_image_classifier
This Python script is a demonstration of building an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras for identifying vegetables and fruits. The code utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify images into various categories. 


## Overview

The provided Python script demonstrates the following steps:

1. Loading and preprocessing image datasets from directories.
2. Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
3. Training the model on the training data with validation.
4. Evaluating the model's performance on a separate test dataset.
5. Saving and loading the trained model for future use.
6. Making predictions on new images.
